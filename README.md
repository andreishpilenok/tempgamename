Current Ideas

1. Something like Guitar Hero/Piano tiles
- could be done pretty easily with one piano song
- measure the times between the notes, when the notes are, if the player presses a key within the right timeframe, the game continues
- add some gui that tells the player when to press
2. A sidescroller
- screen always scrolling leftward, forcing the player to go right to continue
- new stuff keep appearing from the right, which the player has to perform certain actions to overcome
- a high-score style type game
