# Main Idea
Something like Guitar Hero, or more specifically like Piano Tiles(google it if you don't know)
- piano sounds probably will be easiest
- measure the times between the notes, when the notes are, if the player presses a key within the right timeframe, the game continues
- add some gui that tells the player when to press

Three ways I can do this, ordered by simple first:
1. Just play a piano song in the background, time when the player has to press a button
2. Make the actual next note play on button press(would need a much more rigorous asset library for this).
3. Make it somehow read a .midi file.

I'm thinking the controls will just be the middle row of keys. ASDF HJKL for 8 fingers. All piano keys just compressed into that.

I'll just either make assets or find them somewhere online. I won't really need anything difficult.

# Backup Idea
 A sidescroller
- screen always scrolling leftward, forcing the player to go right to continue
- new stuff keep appearing from the right, which the player has to perform certain actions to overcome
- a high-score style type game
